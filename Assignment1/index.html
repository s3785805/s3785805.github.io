										<h2>Personal Info</h2>
										<p>Name: Eamon Dunne<br />

									<p>I am you're bog standard Irish and British backgrounded white Australian living in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Attended Aquinas College in Ringwood. Worked at a subway for upwards of 3 years until a change in management ended that one. I am big fan of table top gaming as well as the regular kind, I am deeply intrigued by the prospects fo future space exploration, I prefer cats to dogs and grandparents don't believe in the moon landing but think their is an underground government run by Musli'ms.</p>

									<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
									<p>My interest in IT is really pretty undefined, I have been interested in IT ever since I was a young lad sitting on the old family computer playing terrible flash games and watching awful flash cartoons on newgrounds, we also had a copy of morrowind on disc which I played endlessly as well. so I guess my interest in IT really comes down to games but i'm not sure if I would like to work in the field of game development instead maybe just some sort tech guy at a big company where I can blend in with the other tech guys and mini'mize the workload I have to complete or part of some sort of team at a smaller company with the modern day corporate culture you see at tech companies like google and little start ups. more current IT experience really just comes down to what I learnt in school, building my own PC at home, helping fix the problems of family members and just miscellaneous messing around with other areas on my computer.</p>
									<p></p>
									<p>i didn't really choose to come to RMIT, nearing the end of year 12 I had given do anything related to school and was just drifting from place to place watching the days fly by when I was told the deadline to apply for uni was extremely soon and that if I wanted to go I had to apply now, so I looked up IT on the VTAC website and and put in the filled my preferences with the first ones that showed up. a month or so later ATAR scores were released and a few weeks after that people started to hear back from universities, I got accepted into RMIT and that was that, I tossed up between putting it off for a year but in the end made the decision to give my life some order and enrolled and now here I am, pretty lucky as well because RMIT's supposed to be pretty good and people seem to assume i'm smart when I tell them where I go, so I guess I chose to come to RMIT because it showed up first on the VTAC list of IT courses.</p>
									<p></p>
									<p>I expect to learn everything I need to know to make it in the wild world that is the IT workforce. All I really expect is to come out of this degree with the prospect of landing a job that pays well enough and allows me ti'me to do what I want on the side, working a job for insane hours to make insane money is insane to me, I don't really care for large amounts of money all I want is my ti'me. So I expect that i'll learn the tools and skills at RMIT for me to go out and make sure I live my life the way I want to live it in the future.</p>

									<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
									<div class="features">
											<a href="images/job.jpg">
											<img src="images/job.jpg" alt="" />﻿
											<div class="inner">
												<h4><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38626443?searchrequesttoken=9ca8e400-55f8-4e73-9675-bc4311a8bcac&type=standout">A local government Job in the IT field </a></li></h4>
												<p>This position would have me working for the local city council to aid in the IT side of completing the councils latest program of bettering the suburbs. This position is only temporary though and I would of course chosen a more full ti'me job if it had been available but there are many things I like about this, working for the local government in helping better the lives of people living in the area by taking in feedback and i'mplementing programs and infrastructure that the people want is a big plus for me, I would love to work in a job that allows me some form part in helping create a better future for people. Some other pluses are of course that it is in the IT field and that it requires lots of communication with other people as that is something I find quite fulfilling in a job, the chance to work and meet many other people.</p>
											</div>
												<p>From what i've read it seems that this particular job requires knowledge of some areas of business management and accounting, the ability to work on multiple different projects at once, leadership skills in managing IT projects and familiarity with so general IT administration software. </p>
											</div>
											<div class="inner">
												<p> Currently my skill set would probably not land me this job as I do have some knowledge on business management and accounting it's not at the level required. I do however have the skills of multitasking and leadership on my belt as I have had to manager-esque positions at my previous jobs and have shown my capability to manage teams to handle several different tasks throughout the day. My knowledge of IT administration software is novice at best, I have dealt with them before in minor instances but I believe I could pick it up quickly </p>
											</div>
										<div class="inner">
											<p>I could easily pick up these skills in the coming years and be ready to take on a job of the calibre. To achieve skills of business management and accounting as my degree allows for a wide variety of other topics to be taken over the years as well so i could easily pick up some business oriented classes over the next 3 years. The skills of management and multitasking can easily be obtained through working in those very areas, in my ti'me prior to gaining this job i can work as a manager of a team in a variety of different areas and job descriptions so i can easily gain the knowledge on what it is to be a good leader prior to going for this job. finally and IT knowledge and skills i might need can be achieved through my ti'me at RMIT in my IT degree leaving me coming out on the other end with all the skills necessary.</p>

									<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
									<p><b>Myers-Briggs test:</b></p>
									<a href="images/personality.jpg">
									<img src="images/personality.jpg" width="570px" height="430px" alt="" />﻿</a>
									<p>The Myers-Briggs test is eerily accurate in a lot of ways and seem to paint a picture of myself that maybe even i had hadn't stepped back and looked at completely before. The results are sort of calming in a way knowing that everything i'm not alone in the way i think about the world and that its actually rather common.</p>
									<p>well i've always done team work as just setting tasks for everyone to do and then we do them in our own ti'me, no need for micro managing and constant check ups and study sessions, just trust that everyone in the team will carry their weight because you are carrying yours. Maybe this is a reflection of my personality type maybe not.</p>
									<p>well it seems that perhaps i should form a team of like minded individuals and not have anyone in the team who sees themself as a de facto leader who will be pressuring and forcing tasks to be done in a certain matter or place, a team should be lead by the group and work done by the individuals as they see fit, no over one person is better than another and the team dynamic should show that.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="container">
									<p><b>Learning Type Test:</b></p>
								<a href="images/learning type.jpg">
								<img src="images/learning type.jpg" alt="" />﻿</a>
								<p>the results of this test were rather weak, as it showed a very even spread of the different learning types for me. I guess it just means that i cant learn in one specific way, i need to test and see which way works best for different things as one universal way doesn't seem to work for me.</p>
								<p>I guess it mean i'll be more flexible and able to accomodate everyone else if I can work and learn in the same way as all of them and not feel any real downside in a sense.</p>
								<p>When it comes to actually forming the team i guess i don't really need to worry as i can work and get along with anyone in the team, it's more up to the other memebers to work and see who works and who doesnt work for them in the group and i guess i could act as a central point for all if none of them get along relative to this test.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="container">
									<p><b>Big Five Personality test:</b></p>
								<a href="images/big5.jpg">
								<img src="images/big5.jpg" width="702.8px" height="329.7px"alt="" />﻿</a>
								<p>This test shows much the same that the Myers-Briggs test did in painting me as a creative, impulsive, introverted, empathetic neurotic. The Myers-Briggs test went more in depth on all these then this one but the neurotic part, it wasn't much of a part of the other test but i seemed to score very high which i guess makes sense but again i never really thought about these things anything other then just fleeting emotions or current moods but maybe all of this actually is a part of my deeper personality meaning that i will most likely remain this way for most of my life which seems a bit freaky but then again it's just an online test</p>
								<p>This test will have the same impacts on group work that the Myers-Briggs test did. as a rather introverted person i usually wont go out of my way to ask for help on a task as other people need time to finish theirs but then again i would help anyone that asked straight away so really i should trust that people would act the same way in reaction to my plea for help. </p>
								<p>Again the only effect this should have on my team forming is that i would want to be surrounded by people who understand how i work and wont try and force any rivalling ideal or way onto me. Of course you have to make compromises and if we end up in a situation that will require i different way of working and thinking that of course i can get down with that if push comes to shove, but i would prefer it otherwise.</p>

									<h3>Project Ideas</h3>
									<h4>Overview</h4>
									<h5>Uber fuel:</h5>
									<p>Uber fuel: Uber fuel would by just another sub category or extension of the uber family of a transport company using the employees property instead of having to maintain and manage a fleet of their own. Uber fuel in much like the Uber eats in which you take advantage of ubers extensive network of drivers to deliver to you, not food this time but, Petrol. With the advent of the age of automation why should you have to spend your precious time, going out of your way, filling your car up when you could have the petrol brought straight to your door to fill up whenever you need and without the hassle.</p>
									<h4>Motivation</h4>
									<p>With Uber’s extraordinary rise in popularity over the past decade it’s amazing that they haven’t ventured further out into other avenues of profit. With over 2 million active drivers worldwide a fleet of that size can accomplish far more than just ride sharing and food delivery. Uber’s main competition due to its extreme size is people driving themselves around. With over 16 million cars in Australia alone that is a large area of the market there just waiting to be serviced. This new plan would now give Uber a revenue stream from both the car-less and the car owners of the world.</p>
									<h4>Description</h4>
									<p>Uber fuel would be another app to compliment the Uber and Uber eats apps but instead you would be calling upon the endless fleets of Uber drivers to supply you with a certain amount of petrol for your car. You would firstly have a map of the surrounding area showing all the petrol stations nearby with the prices of the specific fuel types. You could then either choose a specific station for your uber driver to pick up the petrol from due to lower prices or other factors or just send out a request for petrol from any local station. A request would be sent out to any Uber Fuel drivers in the vicinity and they would then travel to the petrol station and purchase and retrieve the fuel, there would have to be a system setup in which petrol stations opt in and are fitted with specific equipment to take in the orders over the app and handle the transaction through that and then give out a certain serial number or QR code to the driver who would then upon arrival at the petrol station show show that to the attendant and be able to receive that fuel that has been paid for. Another factor is that in order to carry the amount of fuel that a person may require for their car the Uber fuel driver may have to get a storage tank installed in their car, most likely the boot, so that they can deliver the fuel from the station to the home of the customer. Once the transaction has gone through at the petrol station and the order has been acquired and stored in the tank in the Uber drivers car they will then proceed to drive to the home or wherever the customer may be, all the while the customer can track the driver and also have access to his information in case anything goes wrong. Much in the same way that an Uber eats driver doesn’t pick up your food and then drive away with it, an Uber Fuel driver would also not do this as they are following very similar routine and any funny business can easily be picked up by the customer who would be tracking the driver and then use the information they have access to to make sure that that driver feels the consequences of their action and the fuel is delivered. Once the Uber driver reaches the destination with the fuel they will then hook up a nozzle to their cargo tank and transfer the petrol from the cargo tank into the customers car. This system would cut out all the unnecessary hassle that is driving to the petrol station, maybe having to wait in line for a free nozzle, standing there and having to wait while it fills up and possibly having to listen to the ads that play over the speaker on the pump. All of it would be done by someone else for a small fee and free up your time for much more important matters. </p>
									<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
									<p>For this idea to become a reality it will of course need the main app to be programmed, setup and intertwined with the Uber network to allow for it to call on the pre existing fleet of Uber drivers that already exist. It's also going to require the setup of a sort of secondary app for the petrol stations to use to manage and handle the transaction coming from the Uber fuel app requesting a purchase. Another piece of equipment needed is the external petrol tank to be installed in the cars of willing Uber fuel drivers, instead of having to install it themselves Uber could instead just release an Uber fuel package that when you sign up to be an uber fuel driver they send out and the driver can install it themselves, saving labour costs on Uber’s side.</p>
									<h4>Skills Required </h4>
									<p>Of course to complete this we will require same very capable programmers able to take the pre-existing code in the Uber and Uber eats apps and write and manipulate it to suit the new layout and objectives of the new app, with very little knowledge of app development in my mind i imagine that this task would be tricky but for any expert programmer the act of taking the apps that already exist and modifying them to suit the new idea shouldn’t be impossible. Another thing that will be required though will be the manufacture or purchase of the tanks to be installed in the uber cars. They would have to be of a certain design that they can fit into any car with ease and car be uninstalled with ease too. This is a tricky task as the answer will probably be to purchase these tanks on bulk instead of getting them specially made but then finding a tank that fits all cars will be a task in and of itself</p>
									<h4>Outcome</h4>
									<p>If this project was to be a success then of course we would see yet another avenue of time wasting in our day to day lives vanish and our precious time would become freer once more, not to mention the additional revenue stream coming from an otherwise untapped market. The original problem of wasting time at petrol stations and the necessity of it would be null as no longer would the average man be forced into it as they now have another option. The impact of this project would be small in and of itself but i feel that it’s not the project that makes the difference but more the idea that people will start to think “what else don’t i really need to do anymore” and with that more and more of life's mundane tasks are outsourced to preserve the time and effort of the individual.</p>
